            I'm Rishabh Srivastava, a Third-year Undergraduate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Khargapur. I am a boarder of  Azad Hall of Residence.
I am from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. 
I am a person who is always buzzing with new ideas. As a member of a growing organisation, International Relations Cell, IIT Kharagpur, I always like to come up with new ways to tackle every problem that we face. Being a problem-solver and a goal-oriented person with good managerial and team work skills, I was appointed by the Dean of International Relations to lead the cell as the General Secretary for the academic session 2020-21. 
I am also an avid member of the Technology Dramatics Society - Pravah. I was also a part of the team which represented Azad Hall of Residence in the Dramatics General Championship 2018-19 and bagged the Bronze medal for the same.
Talking about my professional experience, my competence lies in the field of Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Software. One of my major professional achiievement in the Machine Learning Domain is my research paper, titled "Using Genetic Algorithms and Rough Set Based Fuzzy K-Modes to Improve Centroid Model Clustering Performance on Categorical Data" has been published by the International Journal of Computer Sciences and Information Technologies. The project involved proposing an algorithm for effectively clustering categorical data by combining K-Modes, Rough Sets, Fuzzy Sets, and Genetic Algorithm. I was able to achieve great results. Thanks to my never-to-give up attitude which drives me to take another stride to achieve better results.
For my internship following my second year, I applied to the IIMs and was offered a position in the Economics and Social Sciences Department at IIM Bangalore. Here, I worked on a project aimed at studying the dependency of High Court Judgements on the caste of the Petitioners, Respondents, and Judges. It was an enriching experience to see how research is percieved in one of the top B-schools not only in India but also in the World.
